Gonna go ahead and make some UserCards.
Nah. fuck it. no UserCards. its for the people!!!

AWS instead of Heroku? Needs to be dank

Let's also friggin set up a way for people to submit card ideas and shit.
and people can vote and comment on them.
and subposts for image art to go along with proposed cards that can also be voted on.
dank.
like a decentralized card playing game.

Probably gonna have to have a backend for game and like game transactions/history.

Not sure if you can have like post_id for comments belong to cardposts and cardpostimageposts ??
... or like how exactly to implement it. here goes nothing
---StackOverflow dude recommended an implementation of polymorphisms. gonna try that

therefore might want to change cardpostcomments to just comments
but maybe not, so gonna leave it for now
